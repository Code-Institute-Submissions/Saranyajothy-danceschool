# Indian classical dance school
Anugraha  Bharatanatyam school trains children and adults with basic and advanced classes in Bharatanatyam, which is a traditional and popular South Indian dance. The vision of Anugraha Bharatanatyam School is to pass on the heritage to the next generation while keeping the age-old tradition to preserve the culture. We are committed to take classical dance to new generations by welcoming modernisation, fusion and creativity.  Where appropriate, we blend the dance with modern technology to bring the divine art to a global audience and younger generation. Anugraha is one of the finest dance schools in Ireland and dedicatedly providing classes in Cork and Limerick. Over the past eight years the students of Anugraha have performed in various events and stages.
